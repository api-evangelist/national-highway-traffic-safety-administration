      The NHTSA Product Information Catalog Vehicle Listing (vPIC) Application
      Programming Interface (API) provides different ways to gather information
      on Vehicles and their specifications. The vPIC Dataset is populated using
      the information submitted by the Motor Vehicle manufacturers through the
      565 submittals. All the information on how a VIN is assigned by the
      manufacturer is captured in this catalog and used to decode a VIN and
      extract vehicle information.  https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/
